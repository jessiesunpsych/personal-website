abstract: "What do people think their best and worst personality traits are? Do
  their friends agree? Across three samples, 463 college students (“targets”)
  and their friends freely described two traits they most liked and two traits
  they most disliked about the target. Coders categorized these open-ended trait
  descriptors into high or low poles of six trait domains (extraversion,
  agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, openness, and
  honesty-humility) and judged whether targets and friends reported the same
  specific best and worst traits. Best traits almost exclusively reflected high
  levels of the major trait domains (especially high agreeableness and
  extraversion). In contrast, although worst traits typically reflected low
  levels of these traits (especially low emotional stability), they sometimes
  also revealed the downsides of having high levels of these traits (e.g., high
  extraversion: “loud”; high agreeableness: “people-pleaser”). Overall, targets
  and friends mentioned similar kinds of best traits; however, targets
  emphasized low emotional stability worst traits more than friends did, whereas
  friends emphasized low prosociality worst traits more than targets did.
  Targets and friends also showed a moderate amount of self–other agreement on
  what the targets’ best and worst traits were. These results (a) shed light on
  the traits that people consider to be most important in themselves and their
  friends, (b) suggest that the desirability of some traits may be in the eye of
  the beholder, (c) reveals the mixed blessings of different traits, and,
  ultimately, (d) provide a nuanced perspective on what it means for a trait to
  be “good” or “bad.”"
