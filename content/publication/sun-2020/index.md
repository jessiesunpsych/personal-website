abstract: Most people want to change some aspects of their personality, but does this
  phenomenon extend to moral character and to close others? Targets (n = 800) rated
  their personality traits and reported how much they wanted to change on each trait;
  well-acquainted informants (n = 958) rated targets' personality traits and how much
  they wanted the targets to change on those same traits. Targets and informants reported
  a lower desire to change more morally relevant traits (e.g., honesty, compassion,
  fairness) compared with less morally relevant traits (e.g., anxiety, sociability,
  productiveness)—even after we controlled for current trait levels. Moreover, although
  targets generally wanted to improve more on traits that they had less desirable
  levels of, and informants wanted their targets to improve more on those traits as
  well, targets' moral change goals were less calibrated to their current trait levels.
  Finally, informants wanted targets to change in similar ways, but to a lesser extent,
  than targets themselves did. These findings suggest that moral considerations take
  a back seat when it comes to self-improvement.
