abstract: More and more psychological researchers have come to appreciate the perils
  of common but poorly justified research practices and are rethinking commonly held
  standards for evaluating research. As this methodological reform expresses itself
  in psychological research, peer reviewers of such work must also adapt their practices
  to remain relevant. Reviewers of journal submissions wield considerable power to
  promote methodological reform, and thereby contribute to the advancement of a more
  robust psychological literature. We describe concrete practices that reviewers can
  use to encourage transparency, intellectual humility, and more valid assessments
  of the methods and statistics reported in articles.
