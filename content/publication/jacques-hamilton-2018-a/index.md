abstract: 'Evidence suggests that extraverted (i.e., bold, agentic) behavior increases
  positive affect (PA), and could be targeted in wellbeing interventions. However,
  this evidence is either causally ambiguous or has questionable ecological validity,
  and the potential costs of sustained extraverted behavior have received minimal
  attention. To address these limitations, we conducted a randomized controlled trial
  examining the wellbeing benefits and costs of an extraverted behavior intervention
  conducted in everyday life. Participants (n = 147) were randomly assigned to an
  \"act-extraverted\" intervention or a \"sham\" (active control) intervention for
  1 week in everyday life. Additional data for a contact control condition were obtained
  from a previous study (n = 76). Wellbeing outcomes included PA and negative affect
  (NA), feelings of authenticity, and tiredness-assessed both in the moment and retrospectively.
  There was a positive overall effect of the acting extraverted intervention on PA
  and authenticity. However, wellbeing outcomes also depended on dispositional extraversion:
  more introverted participants had weaker PA increases, experienced increased NA
  and tiredness, and decreased feelings of authenticity. Implications for wellbeing
  interventions and personality theory are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)
