## What Are the Psychological Connections Between Well-Being and Morality?

Well-being and morality are inextricably intertwined in philosophical theory. However, empirical work on the connections between well-being and morality is in its infancy, leaving many basic questions unanswered. As a first step, I am currently investigating **whether moral character is associated with well-being**. In other words, is a life that is good for oneself also one that is good for others, or does doing the right thing come at an inherent cost to the self? 

To circumvent the limitations of self-reported measures of morality, I am currently working on a three-study project that uses **reputation-based measures of moral character** (Sun, Wu, & Goodwin, in prep). To complement this reputation-based approach, I also plan to use objective behaviors (e.g., pledging to donate 10% of oneâ€™s lifetime income to charity, see https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge) as criteria for moral exemplarity in subsequent studies.

These studies will provide a foundation for an extensive research program on the connections between well-being and morality. In future studies, I will address questions of **generality, mechanism, and causality**. For example, is the association between well-being and morality stronger for kindness than for integrity-related traits (e.g., honesty and fairness)? If moral people are happier, can this association be better explained by moral need satisfaction or social rewards? Finally, **would people be happier if they [became more moral](https://jessiesun.me/research/moralimprovement/)?**
