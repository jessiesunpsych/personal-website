## Disclaimer

My job market materials and experiences are primarily applicable to those who are applying for research-intensive positions in psychology departments in the U.S. and the U.K. None of this is meant to be prescriptive advice; YMMV!! Rather, because I benefited a lot from other people sharing their materials and experiences with me, I wanted to make my materials available as further *examples* that might be helpful, and to share my subjective impressions about the process.

## Job Market Materials

Please visit [this OSF repository](https://osf.io/4a38g/) to download:

- The materials that [got me the WashU job](https://osf.io/f38xv/) (including my [research](https://osf.io/ru4at/), [teaching](https://osf.io/vnmtc/), and [diversity](https://osf.io/wg48x/) statements and [job talk slides](https://osf.io/74869/))
- [Other materials](https://osf.io/gxr26/) that are sometimes requested ([evidence of teaching effectiveness](https://osf.io/7f3qp/), [response to selection criteria](https://osf.io/6ha8j/) for UK jobs, [teaching demo](https://osf.io/h9ejp/))
- [Interview prep documents](https://osf.io/x9k8r/) (questions to [ask](https://osf.io/2nywx/) and [be prepared to answer](https://osf.io/7jznp/))

For those who make it to the offer stage, I am also happy to share my startup request and negotiation experiences upon request.
